                                            **TESTING JPA ENTITIES**

_Testing JPA Entities_ typically involves verifying that the entities can be persisted to the database correctly and that the relationships between entities are properly maintained. Here are some steps you can follow to test JPA Entities:

Create test data: Before you start testing, you need to create some test data that you can use to test the entities. This can be done by creating instances of the entities and setting their properties to some test values.

Persist the entities: Use the EntityManager to persist the entities to the database. Verify that the entities were persisted correctly by querying the database to retrieve the entities and checking that their properties are correct.

Test relationships: If your entities have relationships with other entities, test that these relationships are being maintained correctly. For example, if you have a one-to-many relationship between two entities, test that adding or removing entities from the relationship updates the database correctly.

Test queries: Test that queries on your entities return the correct results. You can use the Criteria API or JPQL to write queries and verify that the results are correct.

Test transactions: Test that transactions are being handled correctly when working with your entities. For example, test that when an exception is thrown during a transaction, the changes made to the database are rolled back.

Clean up: After each test, make sure to clean up the test data that was created. This can be done by using the EntityManager to remove the entities from the database.

Overall, testing JPA Entities involves verifying that the entities behave as expected and that the database is updated correctly.
